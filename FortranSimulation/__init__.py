"""
Input_to_spin_simulation:
    This module contains functions that can generate input to the Fortran simulation
    that we use to find the spin current

generated_input:
    A batch of folders which we can use to perform Fortran simualations. This is also an example
    of what the functions in Input_to_spin_simulation uses

Fortran Results:
    This folder holds results from the Fortran Simulation, which were used in the experiments 
    presented in the report
