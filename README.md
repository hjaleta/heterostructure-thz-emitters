This repository contains several modules. For more details, see the documentation for respective module in the corresponding folder.

Input_to_spin_simulation:
    This module's purpose is to simplify the execution of Pavel Balaz's Superdiffusive Spin Transport script in Fortran. 

EfieldSimulation:
    This module aims to represent the simulated system. It takes the output from the Fortran code as its input, and outputs Electric fields.

Frequency:
    This module contains script that analyze the frequenzy properties of the simulated E-field.

PipelineTools:
